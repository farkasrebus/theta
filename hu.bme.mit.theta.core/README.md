This project provides classes and utilities to build and manipulate first order logic (FOL) expressions.

Classes include
* types (e.g., int, bool),
* declarations (e.g., constants, variables),
* expressions (e.g., logical connectives, arithmetic operations),
* models (e.g., assignments, valuations),
* statements (e.g., assign, ifelse, while).

Utilities include folding, unfolding, collecting atoms, collecting variables, etc.
