# For developers

<<<<<<< HEAD
Theta is written in Java 8 using [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) as a build system. We are developing both on Windows and Linux.

## Preferred development workflow

As the main repository is read-only, we suggest you to create your own _fork_. Within your fork, we also recommend to create new _branches_ for your development. This enables us later on to easily integrate your work into the main repository by using _pull requests_.

As the framework is under development, we suggest you to sync your fork often and merge the master branch into your development branch(es). See [https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/).

## Building from the command line
Thanks to the Gradle Wrapper, no installation is required. The projects can be simply built from the command line using `gradlew.bat` (Windows) or `gradlew` (Linux).

## Importing to Eclipse

* The projects are currently developed and tested with **Eclipse Neon**.
* Install a Gradle Eclipse plugin from the **Eclipse Marketplace**, e.g. the **Buildship: Eclipse Plug-ins for Gradle** (search for _Buildship Gradle Integration_).
  * _Optional: Also install the Eclipse Groovy tooling from <https://github.com/groovy/groovy-eclipse/wiki>._
* To import the projects, choose **Import...** | **Gradle Project**, specify the root directory as the repository directory and import them with the default **Gradle distribution** (**Gradle wrapper (recommended)**).
* At this point the projects may contain errors (due to some files not being generated). Open a console at the repository root directory and type `./gradlew build` on Linux or `gradlew.bat build` on Windows. After the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message, refresh the projects in Eclipse.
* If you use the Z3 solver, open the project `hu.bme.mit.theta.solver.z3` and right click on `com.microsoft.z3.jar` under _Project and External Dependencies_. Select _Build path_ / _Configure Build Path..._ and on the _Libraries_ tab select the _Native library location_ entry under _Project and External Dependencies_. Click on _Edit_ and browse the _lib_ folder that is in the root directory of the repository.
* There is a code formatting profile (ThetaFormatterProfile.xml) in this directory. In Eclipse, go to _Window_ / _Preferences_ / _Java_ / _Code Style_ / _Formatter_ and import the profile. You enable automatic formatting on save under _Java_ / _Editor_ / _Save Actions_.
=======
Theta is written in Java 8 using
* [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) as a build system,
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/FTSRG/theta) for version control,
* [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/FTSRG/theta) for continuous integration,
* [Codacy](https://www.codacy.com/app/FTSRG/theta/dashboard) for static code analysis.

We are developing both on Windows and Linux. Theta can be built from command line, but you can most likely also import it into your favorite IDE.

## Recommended development workflow

As the main repository is read-only, we suggest you to create your own [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/). Within your fork, we also recommend to create new _branches_ for your development. This enables us later on to easily integrate your work into the main repository by using [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).

As the framework is under development, we suggest you to [sync your fork](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/) often and merge the master branch into your development branch(es).

## Importing and developing in Eclipse

The projects are currently developed and tested with [Eclipse Oxygen](https://www.eclipse.org/oxygen/).
* We recommend downloading the [_Eclipse IDE for Java Developers_ package](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/eclipse-packages/), as it contains a Git client and Gradle integration.
* If Gradle integration is not part of your installed Eclipse, install it from the _Eclipse Marketplace_, e.g. the _Buildship: Eclipse Plug-ins for Gradle_ (search for _Buildship Gradle Integration_).
  * _Optional: Also install the Eclipse Groovy tooling from <https://github.com/groovy/groovy-eclipse/wiki>._
* Add your fork (or the main repository) to Eclipse in the _Git Repositories_ window.
* To import the projects, choose _File / Import..._ / _Gradle_ / _Existing Gradle Project_, specify the root directory and use the default settings.
* At this point the projects may contain errors (due to some files not being generated). Open a console at the repository root directory and type `./gradlew build` on Linux or `gradlew.bat build` on Windows. After the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message, refresh the projects in Eclipse.
* If you use the Z3 solver, open the project `hu.bme.mit.theta.solver.z3` and right click on `com.microsoft.z3.jar` under _Project and External Dependencies_. Select _Build path_ / _Configure Build Path..._ and on the _Libraries_ tab select the _Native library location_ entry under _Project and External Dependencies_. Click on _Edit_ and browse the _lib_ folder that is in the root directory of the repository.
  * If you work on Windows, read the README in the _lib_ directory.
* There is a code formatting profile (ThetaFormatterProfile.xml) in this directory. In Eclipse, go to _Window_ / _Preferences_ / _Java_ / _Code Style_ / _Formatter_ and import the profile. You can enable automatic formatting on save under _Java_ / _Editor_ / _Save Actions_.
