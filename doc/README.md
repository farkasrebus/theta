# Information

Theta is a generic, modular and configurable model checking framework providing:

* **Formalisms** to describe software/hardware systems, e.g., symbolic transition systems, timed automata, control flow automata.
* **Algorithms** for the verification of formalisms, e.g., CEGAR-based reachability analysis.

If you want to use the existing algorithms and tools defined in Theta, then take look at [Tools.md](Tools.md). If you want to extend Theta and build your own algorithms and tools, then take look at [For-developers.md](For-developers.md), [Architecture.md](Architecture.md) and [Coding-conventions.md](Coding-conventions.md).
